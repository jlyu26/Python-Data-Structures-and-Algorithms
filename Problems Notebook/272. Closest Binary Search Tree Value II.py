# 272. Closest Binary Search Tree Value II

# Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

# Given target value is a floating point.
# You may assume k is always valid, that is: k â‰¤ total nodes.
# You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of k values in the BST that are closest to the target.

# Example
# Given root = {1}, target = 0.000000, k = 1, return [1].

# Challenge
# Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than O(n) runtime (where n = total nodes)?
